                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                  You will find below details about the terms and conditions you agree to by using Boost ctRL. I invite you to fully read it and make sure you understand its content prior to using Boost ctRL.
                </p>
                <h3>Boost ctRL: Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <p>
                  Zac Johnson operates the website and the Boost ctRL mobile application (the “Service”) also known as Boost ctRL (name on the AppStore subject to change for search and discovery purposes).
The app is made available to you on an “as in”, “with all faults and “as available” basis.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The app relies on data available via http://rocketleagueesports.com and like any platform (ie: “the app”) built on top of a public API subject to change, I cannot guarantee that the app will function or maintain the same level of service in the future. That is applicable for all users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Boost ctRL. By signing up to use Boost ctRL, your use of the app is at your own discretion and risk. Boost ctRL makes no claims or promises with respect to the quality, the accuracy or reliability of the app, its safety or security, or its content.
                </p>  
                <p>
                  To use Boost ctRL, there is no need to log in or provide an email address for log in purposes. These permissions are subject to change at any time while you use the app.
                </p>
                <h3>Boost ctRL: Privacy Policy</h3>
                <h4>A. Personally Identifiable Data</h4>
                <p>No such data is collected by the app.</p>
                <h4>B. Analytics Data</h4>
                <p>No such data is collected by the app.</p>
                <h4>C. Usage data</h4>
                <p>We may also collect information based on your usage of the app. This is always done with the sole purpose of improving the experience for Boost ctRL’s users.</p>
                <p>Examples: e.g. frequency and duration of usage, significant events and encountered errors if application has crashed etc. Some of this data is processed by Firebase Analytics (which tracks user engagement and major events happening inside the app to provide insights to developers) and Crashlytics (which provide crash reporting insights allowing developers to fix issues faced by users while they experience the app).</p>
                <h4>Where are your data stored?</h4>
                <p>I use <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> to store your usage data in a secure way.</p>
                <h4>Can I request that Boost ctRL deletes all the data collected about me?</h4>
                <p>Yes, you can email me at boostctrlapp@gmail.com with the subject line “Boost ctRL - Data deletion request” and let me know that you would like to see your data deleted.  I will then proceed with the deletion of your data in a timely manner (I read my emails very regularly) and you will get notified once this is done. Note that once you use the app again, usage data will be collected again.</p>
                <h4>I have a question about my data</h4>
                <p>If you have a question about this privacy and how your data are collected, used and stored when you use Boost ctRL, please feel free to email me at boostctrlapp@gmail.com with the subject line “Data question” and let me know how I can help you.</p>
                <h4>Changes & updates</h4>
                <p>If Boost ctRL makes changes to Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy, these changes will be posted on the page in a timely manner. We reserve the right to modify these terms & conditions and/or privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently (at least on every app update).</p>
